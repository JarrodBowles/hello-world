Hi Humans,

Your planet is outrageously beautiful, although your gravity does restrict an alarming amount of grominath progress. That said, the good news is that your planet only has about 20 earth years left before renovations and some great reconstruction. With that there will, of course, be a moral cleaning as well. There will be a lot of deaths.. the majority. Look at butterflies more.
